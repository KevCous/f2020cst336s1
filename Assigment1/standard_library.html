                The C++ standard consists of two parts: the core language and 
                the standard library. C++ programmers expect the latter on every
                major implementation of C++; it includes aggregate types 
                (vectors, lists, maps, sets, queues, stacks, arrays, tuples), 
                algorithms (find, for_each, binary_search, random_shuffle, etc.), 
                input/output facilities (iostream, for reading from and writing 
                to the console and files), filesystem library, localisation 
                support, smart pointers for automatic memory management, regular
                expression support, multi-threading library, atomics support 
                (allowing a variable to be read or written to by at most one 
                thread at a time without any external synchronisation), time 
                utilities (measurement, getting current time, etc.), a system 
                for converting error reporting that doesn't use C++ exceptions 
                into C++ exceptions, a random number generator and a slightly 
                modified version of the C standard library (to make it comply 
                with the C++ type system).
