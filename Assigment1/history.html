                <p>In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a computer scientist, 
                began work on "C with Classes", the predecessor to C++. The 
                motivation for creating a new language originated from 
                Stroustrup's experience in programming for his PhD thesis. 
                Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful 
                for large software development, but the language was too slow 
                for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be 
                suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started 
                working in AT&T Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the 
                UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Remembering 
                his Ph.D. experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the C 
                language with Simula-like features. C was chosen because it 
                was general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used. As well as 
                C and Simula's influences, other languages also influenced this 
                new language, including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU and ML.</p>
